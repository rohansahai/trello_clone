	This is a clone of www.trello.com. A project management site in which one can create boards, lists, and cards to organize they're projects/todos/activities. The ultimate goal of this app was to build out functioning application that utilizes backbone.js to the fullest degree! This is a single page application... everytime you drag and drop a card or list around the changes are saved to the database ;) . Create a board, and then create some lists, and then create some cards to get started! - Rohan Sahai (Software Developer)
