# Trellino!

This is a clone of www.trello.com. A project management site in which one can create boards, lists, and cards to organize they're projects/todos/activities. This is a single page application created using backbone.js ... everytime you drag and drop a card or list around the changes are saved to the database via backbone ajax requests ;)
